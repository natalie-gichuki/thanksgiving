 Hello and welcome to my project.
 In this project i have built a thanksgiving plan purely from html and css as i build on my skills and knowledge in proramming.
 
 
 Below is the css guide

The body is styled as a flex container with a column layout.
2. Navigation Bar (nav.navbar)
Positioned at the top of the page with a semi-transparent purple background.
Contains a logo, two textual elements (logo-text1, logo-text2), and navigation links.
Navigation links increase in size and change color on hover.
3. Banner Section (section.banner)
Uses a full-screen background image (thanks.jpg).
Includes a dark overlay for contrast and centers the banner content.
4. Guest List Section (section.guests)
Displays guest information over a darkened background.
Uses a table format with white text for readability.
5. Meals Section (section.meals)
Similar to the guests section but focused on listing meals.
Uses a centered table with formatted headers and content.
6. Activities Section (section.activities)
Lists fun activities in a structured table layout.
Uses an italicized header for aesthetic appeal.
7. Requirements Section (section.requirements)
Lists necessary purchases or requirements.
Styled similarly to other sections for consistency.
Features
Flexbox Layout: Used for centering and structuring content.
Hover Effects: Applied to navigation links for interactivity.
Overlay Effect: Darkens background images to improve text visibility.
Responsive Design: Uses vw and vh for full-screen sections.
File Dependencies
Images used (e.g., thanks.jpg) should be available in the ./images/ directory.
This CSS should be linked in the corresponding HTML file to apply styles properly.


This is to help you in the navigation of my page.

Thanksgiving Plan (index.html)

The homepage (index.html) includes a banner section with a welcoming message and a footer displaying an acknowledgment.

The banner encourages gratitude and reflection during the Thanksgiving event.

The navigation menu links all sections for seamless browsing.

Dependencies

The style.css file is linked to apply design elements, ensuring responsiveness and readability.

Images (e.g., logo.jpg) should be placed in the ./images/ directory.

How to Use

Open index.html in a browser to view the homepage with the Thanksgiving message.

Navigate between different sections using the navbar.
